# Problem Statement 

## Part 1) Wind and Rain Noise

## Part 2) Airgun, Marine Mammals, Earthquake Noise

1.	Find a short time period that there is a marine mammal vocalization in recorded data and plot its spectrogram

2.	Find a short time period that there is an airgun noise in recorded data and plot its spectrogram

3.	Find a short time period that there is an earthquake or a volcano eruption in recorded data and plot its spectrogram.

4.	Compare the bandwidth of these three signals. Are they consistent with what is shown in the Wenz curve (refer to the Ocean Noise slides)?
