## Project Statement 

### Part 1) Wind and Rain Noise

1. In each site and for each category that you identified in step 3, plot 洧녞洧녡洧냥洧녬洧냣 vs frequency.

2. Compare the spectral levels and answer these questions: 

a) What is the effect of wind and rain on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result. 

b) Which one has the highest impact? Rain or wind? 

c) What are the main reasons for observing different spectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore? 



### Part 2) Airgun, Marine Mammals, Earthquake Noise

1.	Find a short time period that there is a marine mammal vocalization in recorded data and plot its spectrogram

2.	Find a short time period that there is an airgun noise in recorded data and plot its spectrogram

3.	Find a short time period that there is an earthquake or a volcano eruption in recorded data and plot its spectrogram.

4.	Compare the bandwidth of these three signals. Are they consistent with what is shown in the Wenz curve (refer to the Ocean Noise slides)?
